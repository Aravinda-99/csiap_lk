                            <p>These major interventions will be considered as components of the this project and each intervention will have a large number of activities to respond to the issues identified during the need assessment process conducted through the consultation meetings, visits to ASCs and the two workshops to develop the ASC. However, it is to be noted that to avoid practical difficulties, these interventions are implemented stage by stage. Therefore, considering the urgency, importance and the practicability, the Project Management Unit of the CSIAP has decided first to support the major intervention viz; the expansion or renovations/rehabilitation to the existing ASC.
