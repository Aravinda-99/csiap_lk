The theme for World Environment Day 2021 is &ldquo;<strong>Ecosystem Restoration</strong>&rdquo;. This year, the Day will also serve as the formal launch of the United Nations Decade on <strong>&ldquo;Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030&rdquo;</strong>. The restoration&nbsp;could occur in many ways &ndash; for example; through actively&nbsp;planting or by&nbsp;removing pressures so that&nbsp;nature&nbsp;could&nbsp;recover on&nbsp;its own. It is&nbsp;not always possible or desirable to return an ecosystem to its&nbsp;original state.&nbsp;We still need farmland and infrastructure on land that was once forest, for instance, and ecosystems, like societies, need to adapt to a changing climate.</div>
    <p>&nbsp;The CSIAP is expected to bring positive environmental benefits to the project areas through the scale-up of climate-resilient agricultural technologies and farming practices that help improve soil health, water use efficiency, and catchment area treatment to promote more efficient use of surface water and more sustainable use of groundwater for agriculture. An Environment Assessment and Management Framework (EAMF) has been prepared to guide the screening of activities for physical investments, project-supported advisory, policy support interventions, resulting in implementation from an environmental perspective, mitigation actions to manage their environmental impacts including preparation, implementation of Environmental Assessments (EAs) and Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) to address site-specific risks and impacts and subsequent monitoring and reporting requirements.</p>
    <p>The CSIAP has taken several actions to&nbsp;bring awareness among the people regarding environmental issues and to take positive steps for the survival of the environment and ecosystem restoration. More than 150 Environmental Screening and Environmental Management Plans were prepared to identify the negative environmental impact and to produce mitigation measures through the project activities. The Green Building Concept was introduced through the 47 ASC modernization activities. It highly emphasized asbestos and led free materials for the use of the rehabilitation process.</p>
    <p>The project has conducted five major production programs which were applied a holistic pest control approach that utilizes all available pest control strategies on a case-by-case basis while maintaining the pest population below at an Economically Injury Level (EIL). Whenever possible, human-animal and ecosystem-friendly pest control strategies are used.</p>

    <p>Irrigation rehabilitation programs are implemented for the rehabilitation, modernization of tanks in the hotspot area. This rehabilitation includes restoration of vegetations around the tanks to minimize water evaporation and absorption of metals in recycled water and desilting. The restoration process was successfully achieved in North Central province replanting 300 trees saving 48 trees during the tank rehabilitation process. &nbsp;The CSIAP was able to save thousands of trees as well as flora and fauna during the implementation of project activities including ASC modernization, tank rehabilitation, agri road rehabilitating and cultivation program. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) is particularly significant in all the Hotspot Areas. To mitigate HEC in the hotspot area, the project has planned a mechanism to build a direct collision with humans and elephants. In order to avoid further intensifying HEC, innovative landscape-level strategies and 410 km extent &ldquo;<strong>Bio Fencing</strong>&rdquo; will be established where wildlife and humans can co-exist in the same landscape.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;A decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 will be declared by the United Nations to Reimagine, Recreate and restore the ecosystem in the world this year. Similar to the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030, the CSIAP has planned to implement the below-mentioned programs to reimagine, recreate and restore the ecosystem in the hotspot area.</p>
    <p><strong>Model Cascade Development -</strong> Project will develop eleven models Cascade to</p>
    <p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Holding the water from monsoons and preventing flood, recharging groundwater and storing water for irrigation, household and other uses</p>
    <p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Support restoration of vegetations around the tanks and</p>
    <p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Minimizing ecological and offsite impacts done by the farmers themselves in HAS. The aim is to enable communities to better cope with climate change impacts while restoration of ecosystem</p>
    <p><strong>Agro-ecological Landscape Resilience Plans -&nbsp;</strong>The project proposes to develop a set of science-based &quot;integrated&quot; climate-resilient agro-ecological landscape plan focusing on the selected cascade of the HSA. This is to understand the biodiversity attributes, ecosystem services and to introduce Nature base Solutions (NbS) for the current issues and seek opportunities to bring in greater environmental and social resilience through appropriate.</p>

It also provides disaster risk reduction benefits including climate resilience, in addition to the sustainable productivity improvement due to quality ecosystems. The project has planned to train project technical staff, extension officers and farmer awareness on agroecology in HAS. To support this process and also to support agriculture extension services, the CSIAP proposes a partnership with the (Internatuional Union of Consevation of Nature (IUCN) to develop an agroecology Training of Trainers manual and guideline.<p><strong>By Dr. Janaka Jayawardena,&nbsp;Environmental and Social Safeguard Specialist, CSIAP.</strong></p>

    <p>The groundnut field day was held at Pulmuddai , Trincomalee on 07<sup>th</sup> this month with the aim of promoting agricultural practices in &nbsp;CSIAP&rsquo;s command areas under the Maha Season. &nbsp;The field day is a special event: A series of demonstration skits, speeches and other activities focused on a central theme are strung out over the course of a day to promote new practices and bring recognition to successful farmers and agricultural workers in a particular area. The prevailing mood is festive and the atmosphere is not unlike that of a country fair. The point of such a day is to call attention to new and exciting developments in agriculture. The Groundnut cultivation program was initiated by the Deputy Project Director&rsquo;s office in the Eastern Province of Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP) which desperately focusing on uplifting the country from agriculture and improving the living slandered of famers in drystone in Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>This field day was conducted under the patronage of Mr.M.Parameswaran, Deputy Director of Agriculture (Trincomalee) and &nbsp;Dr. R. M.Ariyadasa, Deputy Project Director, CSIAP Project (Eastern Province). The staff of the Department of Agriculture, CSIAP, Community leaders and farmers &nbsp;were present at this ceremony.</p>

The infrastructure supported under the project will be identified and designed based on projections of climate change including the frequency of drought and flood events both to maximize the availability of water to farmers and also to protect land and assets from potential flooding. Climate resilience is defined as the capacity of agricultural systems to respond to drought and flood by resisting or tolerating the impacts and recovering quickly, through integration of adaptation, mitigation, and other climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices.<p>Miss.

<div><strong>Rural women in farming communities face multiple challenges,&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>which risks them of being excluded from benefiting from project activities &nbsp;</strong></div>
<p>During the project preparation and assessment phase, many issues were identified which limits and prevents women from equitably benefiting from and participating in agriculture activities. These issues include: lack of land and asset ownership which limits women&rsquo;s ability to engage and grow their agricultural production and livelihoods (e.g. in Sri Lanka, only 16 % of all privately-owned land belongs to women)<a href="file:///C%3A/Users/User/Desktop/New%20folder%2000/CSIAP%20Empowering%20Rural%20Women.docx#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, lack of access to climate smart agriculture production technologies and marketing, lack of decision-making power as most of the farmer organizations are led by male farmers, inability to fully participate in agriculture activities due&nbsp;household and care responsibilities, additional requirements to hire labour, difficulties in traveling to agriculture lands which are generally away from residential locations, greater risks of impact from the Human elephant conflict (HEC) as women mostly engage in cultivation work during day time when HEC is most prevalent and impacts linked to domestic abuse/gender based violence with increased consumption of alcohol by men.&nbsp;With all these setbacks for rural women, the current COVID pandemic situation increases their vulnerability affecting household income, food security and nutrition.&nbsp;</p>

    </table>The COVID -19 pandemic occurred in end 2019 will limit the future food supply of the country owing not only to the limited availability of food items in the export market but also to the unhealthy financial status of the country to import those. Under this circumstance, the Government of Sri Lanka has launched a Saubhagya National Food Production Drive persuading the cultivation of all food crops. Consistent with the AgStat volume XVI (Department of Agriculture, 2019), it was noted that from the total importation of food items, OFC alone utilizes 39.26% of the food import bill. Further, the decision recently taken by the cabinet of ministers to limit imports except pharmaceuticals and petroleum will create a food shortage in the market in the short run.

In addition to the increases in productivity and production of higher-value crops, it is expected that establishing PGs and facilitating private sector links will lead to increased incomes of beneficiaries due to (a) higher prices for the agricultural produce through better aggregation and new market channels, also resulting from improved market information; (b) potentially reduced input prices resulting from procurement by the PGs in bulk; and (c) increased value addition through CSCs established by the PGs for postharvest activities, including aggregation, cleaning, grading, sorting, and processing.

    The efficient way of preparing nursery for seedlings broadcasting&nbsp;was introduced to farmers in hotspot areas identified by Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP). This method was practically demonstrated in Mahanikawewa and Ranorawa cascades in Anuradhapura District.<br>Seedlings broadcasting is a climate smart technology which is economically and environmentally friendly alternative option to seeding. This achieves what many are looking to accomplish: increase yields and quality, while decreasing costs, inputs and environmental impact.&nbsp;Prior to broadcasting, seedlings need to be raised in a nursery. In order to do this,&nbsp;pre-germinated seeds are sown on trays and seeds become seedlings there.<br>Main advantages of this nursery<div>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Saving water needed for cultivation as seeds become seedlings separately</div>
        <div>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;It provides favourable growth conditions</div>
        <div>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Better care of younger plants as it is easy to look after nursery in a small area against pathogenic infections, pests and diseases and weeds.</div>
        <div>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Nursery helps in making more efficient use of land</div>
        <div>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; It helps to improve crop uniformity in the field</div>
        <div>6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Nursery helps to reduce field management cost</div>Mrs. Gourie Samaraweera, Deputy Director of Agriculture, explained and demonstrated how to prepare a nursery for seedlings broadcasting. Mr. Lakshman Premanath, Deputy Project Director, North Central Province, officials of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and CSIAP also present on the occasion.

</div>
<div>The major benefit on this system is that the drum seeder itself can be also placed on any type of soil. Then seeding can be done easily , quickly and evenly by this drum seeder. In row seeding, the seeds are sowed in furrows made by the boot of the planter and evenly covered with loose soil to a given depth. This ensures uniform sprouting and plant development and simultaneous maturation.<br><br>Eng. Chinthaka Balasooriya of Farm Mechanization Training Centre explained the advantages of using Drum Seeder to farmers.</div>

<div>Expressing his idea on CSIAP furthermore Mr. Sivalingam further added &ldquo;Sri Lanka is vulnerable to climate related natural disasters that have major economic impacts. The hotspot areas in the dry zone have emerged as being particularly susceptible to either flood or drought events, or both. Therefore, hotspot areas have been identified as the most vulnerable to climate events that affect the agriculture production and productivity.&rdquo;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>&ldquo;Climate resilience is defined as the capacity of agriculture system to respond to drought and flood by resisting or tolerating the impacts and recovering quickly through integration of adaptation, mitigation and other climate smart agriculture practices. &nbsp;This project differs from the other projects by using the Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) to identify the problems, challenges and opportunities of smallholder agriculture communities in the hotspot area.&rdquo;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>&nbsp;&ldquo;If we use the correct methods and also the active participation of all stakeholders during the PRA activity and also consultation with other stakeholders and partners, the issues and needs of the farmer communities can be fully understood and addressed through the project intervention. The information gathered from the PRA will be incorporated into a hot spot Area Agriculture Development Plan which will an action plan for the implementation of the project. Therefore, the HSAADP is very important to the CSIAP.&rdquo;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>&ldquo;The HSAADP will also focus on the voice and needs of the socially excluded communities. These communities include women farmers, women farmer origination, women headed farm families physically challenge farmers poor smallholder farmers, farmers who are living under the poverty line, women who are living in the resettled areas or relocated communities, non-titleholders, ethnic minorities in the hotspot areas. Therefore, it is essential that the participation of these excluded communities in the PRA exercise and to count their voice and concerns.&rdquo;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>&ldquo;Based on the HSAADP, sub projects will be identified taking into consideration of the important issues identified and the priorities placed by the communities we are going to identify the subprojects in terms of priority basis in the hotspot area. Therefore, the success of the project intervention and implementation definitely depends on the success of the HSAADP.&rdquo; &nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>World Bank officials, Staff representing PMU (Project Management Unit) and Provincial Deputy Project Director offices of the CSIAP &nbsp;and experts from selected PRA firms were also present on the occasion.</div>

    The World Bank Board of Directors approved a $140 million credit for Sri Lanka to improve the resilience and productivity of agriculture for more than 470,000 small farmers in 6 provinces in the dry zone of the country under the Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP). The provinces selected are those that are most exposed to climate impacts.&nbsp;The new CSIAP will be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Economic Affairs, Livestock Development, Irrigation and Fisheries &amp; Aquatic Resources along with the six Provincial Councils (Northern, North Central, North Western, Eastern, Uva and Southern) in the dry zone.<br><br>The total project cost is $140 million, including a $125 million credit from the International Development Association, with a $10 million contribution from the Government of Sri Lanka and a $5 million contribution from the project beneficiaries. Lanka is particularly vulnerable to climate-related natural disasters such as floods and droughts. The agriculture sector, which contributes approximately 7.7 percent to the country&rsquo;s economy and employs 27 percent of the population, more than 38 percent of whom are women; is especially<br>The objective of CSIAP for Sri Lanka is to improve the productivity and climate resilience of smallholder agriculture in selected hotspot areas. The project has four components.(1) Agriculture Production and Marketing component will improve agriculture productivity and diversification through the adoption of Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices and improved on-farm water management.(2) Water for Agriculture component will facilitate (a) planning for water and other infrastructure necessary to support climate-resilient irrigated agriculture, (b) construction of the planned infrastructure, and (c) co-management of this infrastructure by central/provincial governments and the local community.(3) Project Management component will ensure the quality of overall project management, while ensuring smooth coordination of activity implementation by various agencies and strategic partners at national and subnational levels. This component will finance:(a) the consultancy and operating costs of the Project Management Unit (PMU) and Deputy Project Director (DPD) Offices and of different project executing agencies, including for fiduciary and safeguard aspects; (b) the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of project activities at baseline, midterm, and end of project, including geotagging of the assets created; and (c) information, education, and communication campaigns to make all stakeholders aware of the project.(4) Contingent Emergency Response component will allow for rapid reallocation of project proceeds in the event of a natural disaster or crisis that has caused or is likely to imminently cause a major adverse economic and social impact.</p>
